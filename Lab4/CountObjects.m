function [IMG, noRice, noSmallMacs, noLargeMacs]=CountObjects(in)
%% Lab4, Task 3
%% Finds the number of rows of bricks
%
% Counts objects of different class and displays them in different colors. 
% Input images containing three classes of ojects: grains of rice, snall
% macaronis and large macaronis
%
%% Who has done it
%
% Author: Same LiU-ID and name as in the Lisam submission
% Co-author: You can work in groups of max 2, this is the LiU-ID/name of
% the other member of the group
%
%% Syntax of the function
%      Input arguments:
%           in: the original input RGB color image of type double scaled between 0 and 1
%          
%      Output arguments:
%           IMG: the output RGB color image, displaying the three
%           diffferent classes of objects in different colors
%           noRice: Number of grains of rice in the input image
%           noSmallMacs: Number of small macaromis in the input image
%           noLargeMacs: Number of large macaromis in the input image
%
% You MUST NEVER change the first line
%
%% Basic version control (in case you need more than one attempt)
%
% Version: 1
% Date: today
%
% Gives a history of your submission to Lisam.
% Version and date for this function have to be updated before each
% submission to Lisam (in case you need more than one attempt)
%
%% General rules
%
% 1) Don't change the structure of the template by removing %% lines
%
% 2) Document what you are doing using comments
%
% 3) Before submitting make the code readable by using automatic indentation
%       ctrl-a / ctrl-i
%
% 4) Often you must do something else between the given commands in the
%       template
%
%% Here starts your code.
% Write the appropriate MATLAB commands right after each comment below.
%

%% Make the input color image grayscale, 
% by choosing its most appropriate channel 

bgray =...; % The grayscale version of the input color image
    
%% Threshold your image
% to separate the objects from the backgroound

b_thresh =...; % The thresholded image
    
%% Clean up the binary image 
% Use morphological operations to clean up the binary image from noise. 
% Especially make syre that your cleaned image don't contain any false object
% (i.e. single foreground pixels, or groups of connected foreground pixels, 
% that do not belong to the object classes  

b_clean =...; % Cleaned up binary image

%% Labelling
%  Use labelling to assign every object a unique number

L =...; % Labelled image
    
%% Object features
% Compute relevant object features that you can use to classify 
% the three classes of objects

Stats =... % Create struct with relevant object properties
  
%% Object classification
% Based on your object features, classify the objects, i.e. for each
% labelled object: decide if it belongs to the three classes: Rice, SmallMacs, or LargeMacs 
% In case you didn't suceed in cleaining up all false objects, you should
% discard them here, so they don't count as the classes of objects

Rice = ...% Vector containing the labels of all objects classifies as rice
SmallMacs = ... % Vector containing the labels of all objects classifies as SmallMacs
LargeMacs = ...% Vector containing the labels of all objects classifies as LargeMacs

%% Count the objects for each class.

noRice = ...% Number of rices
noSmallMacs = ... % Number of small macoronis
noLargeMacs = ...% Number of large macoronis

%% Create an RGB-image, IMG, displaying the different classes of objects in different colors
% Use for example: Colored objects on black background, colored objects on
% the original background, highlight the borders of the objects in the
% original image in different colors (or some other way of displayig the
% objects)

IMG = ...  % Output RGB-image displaying the three classes of objects in different colors

%% Test your code on the three test images
% % Your code is supposed to work for the three images:
%
% Image          noRice   noSmallMacs   noLargeMacs
% MacnRice1.tif  48       12            6
% MacnRice2.tif  60       14            6
% MacnRice3.tif  42       11            5
